Description: This package contains the function 'semNested'. It provides an 
    easy solution for researchers to determine if two latent variable models  
    are nested in each other. This is useful in determining whether one is allowed to 
    compare the two models. 
    The output of the function will contain the following outcomes: 
    a. model 1 is nested in model 2
    b. model 2 is nested in model 1
    c. model 2 and model 1 are equal
    d. model 1 and 2 are not nested in each other
    The function is compatable with lavaan objects.
